# liri-node-app

Liri - interpretation app that allows users to look up songs, Twitter posts and movie info.

Through node then liri.js, the client enters one of three cases: my-tweets, spotify-this-song, or movie-this. My-tweets will produce twenty Twitter postings while spotify-this-song and movie-this will prompt questions that will find movies or songs.
